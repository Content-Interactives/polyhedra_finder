# Polyhedra Finder Interactive

This repository contains the code for the **Polyhedra Finder Interactive**, designed to help elementary students explore 3D shapes—identifying and describing solids (like cubes, prisms, pyramids, cones, cylinders) by their **faces**, **edges**, and **vertices** through engaging visuals and instant feedback.

## 📚 Standards & Subjects

This interactive aligns with the following topics and standards:

- **📂 Subject Area**: Elementary Math (Geometry)
- **🔷 Topic**: 3D Shapes — Recognize, name, and describe polyhedra and other solids by counting faces, edges, and vertices; compare attributes across shapes
- **📏 Common Core**:
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.K.G.B.4** – Analyze and compare two- and three-dimensional shapes using informal language to describe similarities, differences, and parts (e.g., number of faces/“corners”) and other attributes.
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.1.G.A.2** – Compose two- and three-dimensional shapes (including cubes, right rectangular prisms, right circular cones, and right circular cylinders) to create a composite shape; understand that a composite shape can be formed from parts.
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.2.G.A.1** – Recognize and draw shapes having specified attributes; identify triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, **and cubes**.
